**Pudina Rice:**

__Things to grind:__

Pudina leaves from 2 bunches of fresh mint
Coconut - half of a frozen pack should do
Green chillies - about 4 spicy ones

__Things to cook:__

Ginger-garlic paste

Rice - 2 cups
Salt to taste

1. Wash the rice thoroughly, soak in water while everything else is being prepared.
2. Pluck out all the leaves from 2 bunches of mint.
3. Heat up some frozen grated coconut. If you have fresh coconut and the means to grate it, more power to you.
4. Blend the mint leaves, coconut, green chillies and some salt with water. Try to remember how much water was used here, so you can account for it later when cooking the rice. The result should look like chutney on the finer side.
5. In an instant pot (or a regular pot if that’s how you like to cook rice), sauté some ginger-garlic paste with your choice of oil.
6. Once the paste loses its raw smell, throw in the blended paste and saute for a minute.
7. Strain the soaked rice and throw it into the pot.
8. Add water to make the rice:water ratio 1:1.5\. Make sure to account for the water in the blended paste.
9. Turn off saute mode and turn on high pressure manual cooking mode. Cook for 8 minutes, or however you normally cook rice.
