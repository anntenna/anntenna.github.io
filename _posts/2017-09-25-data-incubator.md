description: "A fellowship at The Data Incubator at San Francisco- fast tracking my way into a career in data science in a unique city among highly motivated, qualified and passionate people."

Two weeks ago, I moved to San Francisco to "immerse" myself into a fellowship at **[The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com)**, an 8-week data science immersive that aims to help aspiring data scientists land jobs in industry. 

To be honest, having read about **[how selective the program is](https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/15/ny-gets-new-bootcamp-for-data-scientists-its-free-but-harder-to-get-into-than-harvard/)**, I did not expect to be picked in the first round. The process itself took three weeks and a whole lot of time devoted to preparing a project, a video, solving some challenging programming questions, and finally a group interview. All said and done, here I am, among highly qualified and motivated fellows, trying to find a footing in a rapidly growing and highly competitive field.

While the program packs a whole lot of quality information in a short time, it does a commendable job of introducing the nature of a career in the tech industry. Weekly deliverables include a mini project that deals with the topic of the week (this week being MapReduce) and a video requiring you to pitch your capstone project and present your continuing work on it. And then there is the ever-present and all-important task of reaching out to potential employers and subsequent interviews and tests. Not to forget the daily coding challenges on **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)**.

I will be able to present a more holistic review of the program towards the end and talk cogently about its effectiveness in matching fellows with their desired career goals; but for now, I'm just trying to settle into this new pace of life in a new city. My two weeks in San Francisco have the makings of a separate post; however, in the interest of time, I'll keep it short and to the point. In the Bay Area, it is acceptable to ask profound questions to a complete stranger at happy hour - like "What do you want your legacy to be?" or, "If you could learn one skill in an instant, what would it be?". The possibilities of where a serendipitous connection will take you are endless, and there is value in introducing entropy in daily life. 

Thanks to my extremely smart and enterprising friend **[Nishanth](https://twitter.com/n_alapati)**, I came prepared with an open mind, and my personal magic-8 ball (that says YES most of the time). Some resources I found to be extremely useful were: 
1. **[Funcheap](http://sf.funcheap.com/)**
2. **[Bed|n|Build](http://bednbuild.com/)**
3. **[EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)**
If you're lucky and wing it on most evenings and weekends, you might meet **[Michael, the coconut guy](https://www.yelp.com/biz/michael-the-coconut-guy-san-francisco)** at Dolores Park, and wait only 40 minutes in line for some delish icecream at BiRite nearby. Even otherwise, a unique experience is guaranteed. I can only look forward to the next 6 weeks here with an open mind and a free schedule, which is slowly turning out to be an impossible task thanks to the fellowship!
