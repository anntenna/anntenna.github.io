Hello! My name is Anusha Balasubramaniam, and I'm a freelancer specializing in data visualization and analysis. I'm training to be a data scientist, and actively looking for interesting data to delve into. I love working on social data and finding connections and understanding the dynamics between the individual and the collective.
